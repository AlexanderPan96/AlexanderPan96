## About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student at École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS) in Montreal, passionate about **DevSecOps**, **Cloud Security**, and **Security Engineering**. With a unique background in math education and portfolio management, I bring a diverse perspective to building secure, automated, and scalable infrastructure.

## Career Objective

My journey in software engineering has ignited a passion for integrating security into every stage of the development lifecycle. I'm eager to transition into **DevSecOps** and **Cloud Security** roles, where I can:

- Build and automate secure CI/CD pipelines
- Design and implement cloud security architectures
- Develop Infrastructure as Code with security best practices
- Monitor and respond to security threats in cloud environments

**Long-term goal:** Become a Security Engineer/Architect who designs resilient, secure-by-design systems that protect organizations while enabling development velocity.
